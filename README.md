# PCA-with-NumPy

Welcome to this project on Principal Component Analysis with NumPy and Python.
In this project, you will do all the machine learning without using any of the popular machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn and statsmodels. The aim of this project and is to implement all the machinery of the various learning algorithms yourself, so you have a deeper understanding of the fundamentals.
By the time you complete this project, you will be able to implement and apply PCA from scratch using NumPy in Python, conduct basic exploratory data analysis, and create simple data visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
The prerequisites for this project are prior programming experience in Python and a basic understanding of machine learning theory.
